I still own
an old <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Boogie-Board-LCD-Writing-Tablet/dp/B00E8CIGCA>Boogie Board Sync</a>,
but I haven&rsquo;t used it for a while, because the inability to edit the files was a buzzkill.
But now, I bought a new toy: <a href=https://remarkable.com/>reMarkable 2</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still learning how to use it in a really efficient way in my daily life, but one thing I knew
I really, really wanted, was an online sync. And you can get that with a mobile app or a desktop app
(no Linux though). Not enough for me. I wanted git.</p><hr><h2 id=community>Community!</h2><p>There is a <a href=https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable>huge list of extensions</a> and tools
related to reMarkable tablet put together by an avid community. Since the tablet is running an
instance of Linux <em>and</em> offers an <a href=https://remarkablewiki.com/tech/ssh>SSH connection</a> over the
USB cable, you can tinker with the system pretty easily.</p><p>First, there is a package manager called <a href=https://github.com/evidlo/remarkable_entware>Entware</a>.
A few shell commands are you are in business. After the installation and <code>opkg install git</code> you
just got yourself <code>git</code> on your e-ink tablet. How cool is that?</p><h2 id=backing-up>Backing up</h2><p>To take it one step further, you can set up an automatic backup with
<a href=https://github.com/after-eight/regitable>reGitable</a>. This sets up an OS-level service which listens
to changes on filesystem and when something happens, it creates a new commit and pushes it to your
remote repository of choice.</p><p>Now, this is great for keeping track of the history of your files, but it doesn&rsquo;t really help with
the workflow, because your scribbles are represented as proprietary binary <code>.rm</code> files. That format
is being referred to as <em>Lines</em> and even though there are libraries that claim they can process the format
I was not successful in getting a usable picture out of them.</p><p>Truth to be told, there are JPG thumbnails on reMarkable&rsquo;s filesystem, but those have a really low resolution.</p><h2 id=ideal-workflow>Ideal workflow</h2><p>What do I actually want? I want fully functioning live OCR, obviously. So I take a note on remarkable,
it is OCRed and it is stored in git repo where it gets versioned and I can work with it further. Easy peasy.</p><p>So what is the next step for me? I have two options:</p><ol><li>Convert the Lines file which I already have in a repo into a picture and run OCR on top of that.</li><li>Use the OCR to email feature on the tablet and pull emails into the repo.</li></ol><p>Both options are probably viable, but I would really like to learn how to convert the raw files into
something readable on my PC, because that opens up a whole another world of possibilities.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s going to be another blog post.</p></section></article><footer id=post-meta class=clearfix><a href=https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jirkachadima><img class=avatar src=https://blog.jirkachadima.cz/images/avatar.jpg><div><span class=dark>Jirka Chadima</span>
